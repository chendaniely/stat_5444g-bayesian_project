We propose to use the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) Wave 1 dataset
to look at alcohol consumption behavior in adolessence.

We aim to compare a Bayesian Approach to a Classical Approach.

The outcome of interest, alcohol consumption behavior, is a three-level categorical variable:

- Does not drink alcohol
- Drinks alcohol
- Risky Drinker (5+ males; 4+ females)

2 Main exposures of interest are school curriculum and school relationships.
The bayesian approach will depend on the classical method picked.
The data is probably best fitted using a multinomial logit regression.
However, for simplicity we can binarize the reponse to drinker/non-drinker and perform a logistic regression.

We can also look at a discrete/continuous variable as an outcome as another backup option.
Contionuous/discrete variables in the data are:

- num times in a physicial fight because of drinking, past 12 momths
- num times drive after drinking, past 30 days
- num days drinking alcohol, past 12 months

We plan to adjust for age, biological sex, and race/ethnicity.
